 <li>The Overtime: Overtime = number of hours exceeding 40 * Rate* 1.5</li>

 <li>State Tax:         State Tax = gross * 6%</li>

 <li>Federal Tax:    fed Tax = Gross * 12%</li>

 <li>Union fees:    Union fees = Gross * 2%</li>

 <li>Net:              Net = Gross – (state tax + fed tax + Union fees).</li>

 <li>Total Gross for all employees.</li>

 <li>Average Gross for all employees.</li>

</ol>
